    "## Step 3: Train a recommmender model on the ratings data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data is now stored in Elasticsearch and you will use the ratings data to build a collaborative filtering recommendation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) is a recommendation approach that is effectively based on the \"wisdom of the crowd\". It makes the assumption that, if two people share similar preferences, then the things that one of them prefers could be good recommendations to make to the other. In other words, if user A tends to like certain movies, and user B shares some of these preferences with user A, then the movies that user A likes, that user B _has not yet seen_, may well be movies that user B will also like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar manner, we can think about _items_ as being similar if they tend to be rated highly by the same people, on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence these models are based on the combined, collaborative preferences and behavior of all users in aggregate. They tend to be very effective in practice (provided you have enough preference data to train the model). The ratings data you have is a form of _explicit preference data_, perfect for training collaborative filtering models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternating Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternating Least Squares (ALS) is a specific algorithm for solving a type of collaborative filtering model known as [matrix factorization (MF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition). The core idea of MF is to represent the ratings as a _user-item ratings matrix_. In the diagram below you will see this matrix on the left (with users as _rows_ and movies as _columns_). The entries in this matrix are the ratings given by users to movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice that the matrix has _missing entries_ because not all users have rated all movies. In this situation we refer to the data as _sparse_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![als-diagram.png](../doc/source/images/als-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "MF methods aim to find two much smaller matrices (one representing the _users_ and the other the _items_) that, when multiplied together, re-construct the original ratings matrix as closely as possible. This is know as _factorizing_ the original matrix, hence the name of the technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two smaller matrices are called _factor matrices_ (or _latent features_). The user and movie factor matrices are illustrated on the right in the diagram above. The idea is that each user factor vector is a compressed representation of the user's preferences and behavior. Likewise, each item factor vector is a compressed representation of the item. Once the model is trained, the factor vectors can be used to make recommendations, which is what you will do in the following sections.\n",
